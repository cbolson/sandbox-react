# React learning projects

## About

My learning adventure with React.

## Initial observations:

- Pretty straight forward. Just away to create bloated JavaScript.
- Prop handling is clumsy - having to pass props through every child component seems so redundant
- For an intelligent framework, why do you have to import everything all the time? If you declare a hook, it should "know" that it needs to import the corresponding files without having to declare them repeatably for every component.
- Typescript just overly complicates without (so far) adding any real value. However, I can see how it might be useful on team projects to ensure that the correct data types are passed.
