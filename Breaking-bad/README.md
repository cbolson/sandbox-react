# React Breaking Bad

## About

Coding challenge to create a dynamic Breaking Bad logo generator

## Information

Coding Challenge Rules:

- Allow user to input two words
- on type (or button click - to add) a logo will be created using the words and comparing the string to an array of chemical charaters.
- Attempt to get 2 char symbols first, starting from the left.
- Styled to Breaking Bad

## Added/Modified

- Used simple CSS rather than styled-components as they provided no benefit in this use case.
- Removed "button" as the code is creating the logo on type.

## To do

- Convert to use JSON array of chemical symbols to then also add their numeric value
- Change functionality to create the logo on button click rather than on change.
- IDEA - Convert to string as opposed to 2 words. Breakify each word in string
