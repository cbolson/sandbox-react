# React Dot Tracker

## About

Coding challenge to track mouse clicks on doc.

## Information

Coding Challenge Rules:

1. Create a react application that allows users to click the screen and leave a dot (10px x 10px)
2. create an "undo" button that allows users to remove the last dot.
- it can be clicked as many times as needed. (until all dots are removed.)
3. create a "redo" button that puts the dots back on the screen.
- it can be clicked as many times as needed. (until all dots are restored.)

## Added
- ghost dots removed using undo
- clear cache when new dot is added to avoid the "reset" button adding old dots back in after we have continued adding dots after removing others.
